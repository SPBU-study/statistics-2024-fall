## My name is Nikita Denisov and this is my part of work:
1. Found [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) about covid-19 (before that I viewed 10+ other datasets on kaggle.com)
2. Found [baseline](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hotessy/capri-exponential-model-using-pymc3) notebook that try to do thing with this dataset using PyMC
3. Reproduce baseline in another notebook
   - Set up an environment
   - Rewrite deprecated things in notebook (guy used pymc3 and some strange parts of code so it was not a trivial work â€” 100+ tabs in Google and 20+ requests to Perplexity)
   - Debug code & think about how to improve baseline
4. Collect and analyze results of reproduction & filtering experiment
5. Write [README.md](README.md)
